Context Free Editor
===================
Context Free Editor is a front end for the Context Free
command line version.

Run ContextEditor.rb (you will need chmod +x this file)
and start writing your cfdg files.

You will need Ruby and Ruby-Gnome2.

Context Free Editor uses the cfdg binary file included
in the binary folder, so you don't need to compile it.
Anyway, you can replace this file with your own compiled
version.

Changes
=======
* New toolbar with the crop, width, height and variation code options.
* Removed the render size window, we don't need it now.
* added line number to statusbar.
* new buttons added to the main toolbar.

Notes
=====
This software has not been updated since 2005. The included cfdg binary is also an old copy.
